!! Append-as-you-go record of computed fragment energies
module mqc_checkpoint
   !! Writes each fragment energy as it is produced, and reads them back so a
   !! rerun computes only what is missing.
   !!
   !! **The file is appended, not written at the end.** Every line is flushed
   !! as it is recorded, so what survives a kill is every fragment that
   !! finished before it -- where the fragment table, written once after the
   !! expansion, leaves nothing.
   !!
   !! **Terms are keyed by their monomers, not by their index.** A screened run
   !! and a full run number the same dimer differently, so an index-keyed
   !! checkpoint would pair energies with the wrong fragments the first time
   !! anyone resumed a screened list against a full one.
   !!
   !! **The header carries a fingerprint and a mismatch is fatal.** Reusing an
   !! energy computed for a different geometry, basis or functional finishes
   !! early and reports a converged total with nothing wrong on the face of it,
   !! so it is refused rather than warned about.
   !!
   !! A truncated final line -- the job died mid-write -- is dropped rather
   !! than being an error. That is the expected state of a checkpoint from a
   !! killed run, which is exactly the case this is for.
