!! Stage timing, and a report that says where a method spent its wall clock
module mqc_timing
   !! One accumulator per named stage, and one table at the end.
   !!
   !! **Wall, not CPU.** `pic_timer` reads `omp_get_wtime` when PIC is built
   !! threaded and `system_clock` otherwise; both are elapsed real time.
   !!
   !! **The shape is lap timing.** One clock runs from `start` to `finish`, and
   !! each `lap` attributes everything since the previous lap to a named stage.
   !! `begin` is the announcement and `lap` the measurement: `begin` names the
   !! stage on the way in, and the matching `lap` needs no argument.
   !!
   !! Stages are created on first mention, so a caller adds one by naming it and
   !! nothing has to be declared up front. Laps accumulate, so a stage inside a
   !! loop reports its total and its call count rather than the last pass.
   !!
   !! `report` prints the residual between the total and the sum of the stages
   !! as `other`, so a missing `lap` shows up there rather than vanishing.
