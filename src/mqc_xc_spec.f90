!! What a functional name means, as a composition
module mqc_xc_spec
   !! Turns a functional name into the pieces a calculation has to assemble.
   !!
   !! For almost every functional this is a formality: libxc knows the name, owns
   !! the definition, and reports its own exact-exchange fraction through
   !! `xc_hyb_exx_coef`, so the spec is one component with weight one.
   !!
   !! **Double hybrids are the exception, and the reason this module exists.**
   !! libxc 7.1.2 carries no such functional at all -- B2PLYP, DSD-PBEP86 and the
   !! XYG family are absent -- so a double hybrid has to be built out of libxc's
   !! individual exchange and correlation functionals, an exact-exchange fraction
   !! and a second-order perturbative fraction.
   !!
   !! Those weights are therefore **our data**. Every coefficient appears exactly
   !! once, here, with the paper it came from beside it; component functionals
   !! are named rather than numbered, so a rename fails loudly at resolution
   !! rather than silently selecting a different functional; and the defining
   !! relation of a double hybrid -- semilocal weights the complements of the
   !! exact-exchange and perturbative fractions -- is asserted in the tests.
   !!
   !! No libxc dependency: this is a specification, not an evaluation, so it
   !! builds and is testable whether or not `MQC_ENABLE_LIBXC` is on.
