!! Hartree-Fock method implementation for metalquicha
module mqc_method_hf
   !! Hartree-Fock, and the MP2 and coupled-cluster corrections built on it.
   !!
   !! Dispatches to whichever backend `model.backend` names: the CPU one
   !! through `mqc_czt_bridge`, or the GPU one through `mqc_cuest_bridge`.
   !! cuEST has no conventional four-index ERI path, so J and K are always
   !! density-fitted there and an auxiliary (JKFIT) basis is required alongside
   !! the orbital basis.
