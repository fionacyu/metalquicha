!! Drive a geometry optimization over any method this program can gradient
module mqc_geometry_optimizer
   !! An optimization is a loop *over* calculations, so it sits above
   !! `run_calculation`, and the dispatch is in `main` rather than in
   !! `mqc_driver` to keep the two out of a circular dependency.
   !!
   !! **MPI shape.** Rank 0 runs the optimizer and decides every step; the other
   !! ranks sit in `worker_loop` waiting to be told a geometry. Steps are never
   !! recomputed per rank -- two ranks that disagreed in the last bits of a
   !! coordinate would build different fragments and the job would hang rather
   !! than fail.
