   !! **The choice is per run and not per fragment.** `E_IJ^0 - E_I^0 - E_J^0`
   !! is a difference of three energies, and is an interaction energy only if

   integer, parameter, public :: N_EFP_TERMS = 6

   !! exchange repulsion, dispersion, charge transfer, and their total.

   integer, parameter, public :: N_EFMO_TERMS = 8
   !! The sums an EFMO energy is reported as; `EFMO_TERM_NAMES` names them in
   !! slot order. Eight rather than the six of the energy expression because the far half is
   !! reported term by term: the four effective-fragment terms are what a

   !! would hide which one disagreed.

   !! `qm_nmer_correction` is `sum_S dE_S^0` over the near groups of two or
   !! more fragments -- at level two the dimer corrections
   !! `E_IJ^0 - E_I^0 - E_J^0`, above it those plus the higher many-body terms.
   !!
   !! `induction_correction` is `sum_S dE_S^pol`, the same many-body difference
   !! applied to each group's own induction, and is **subtracted** from the
   !! total; at level two it is `sum_IJ E_IJ^pol`. It is reported with the sign
   !! it has as a sum, not with the sign it enters with, so that it can be

   integer, parameter, public :: N_SAPT2_TERMS = 18

   ! How much memory a rank will spend on stored two-electron integrals.

   real(dp), parameter, public :: ERI_CORE_BUDGET_CAP = 2.0e9_dp
      !! Ceiling on what one rank may spend on stored two-electron integrals.
      !!
      !! The tensor is the full n^4, not the eightfold-unique set, so the cap is
      !! reached at 128 functions.

   real(dp), parameter, public :: ERI_CORE_BUDGET_SHARE = 0.25_dp
      !! Fraction of *currently available* memory a rank will claim.
      !!
      !! Available rather than installed, so several ranks on one node degrade
      !! toward smaller claims -- a rank deciding later sees what the earlier
      !! ones already took -- without needing a count that is not discoverable
      !! here. Ranks deciding at the same instant see the same number, which is
      !! why the share is a quarter and not a half. Claiming too much is fatal;
      !! claiming too little falls back to a direct build, which is slower and
      !! correct.

   real(dp), parameter, public :: ERI_CORE_BUDGET_BLIND = 5.0e8_dp
      !! What to allow when available memory cannot be read at all.
      !!
      !! /proc/meminfo is Linux; macOS and anything else land here. Half a
      !! gigabyte is 94 functions, which keeps the small fragments a
      !! fragmented run is made of while refusing to guess on a machine this
      !! cannot measure.

   real(dp), parameter, public :: SAPT_CORE_BUDGET_SHARE = 0.8_dp
      !! Fraction of available memory a SAPT run may size itself against.
      !!
      !! Far above `ERI_CORE_BUDGET_SHARE` because SAPT has no direct path:
      !! every term is a contraction over the stored dimer tensor, so refusing
      !! the memory refuses the calculation, where an SCF only gets slower. The
      !! guard turns an OOM kill into a message naming the basis, and should
      !! refuse only what genuinely cannot run.

   real(dp), parameter, public :: DF_METRIC_PANEL_BYTES = 8.0e6_dp
      !! Working size of one row panel of the fitted-tensor metric contraction.
      !!
      !! `B = (mn|Q) J^(-1/2)` is split over the pair index so that each thread
      !! reads its own slice of the three-centre tensor rather than all of it,
      !! and this is how tall a slice is. The panel is packed per thread and
      !! lives for the whole call, so the cost is this times the thread count.
   ! TODO(mqc): 8 MB here, where the sizing argument that came with it was
   ! written for two -- a hundred threads hold 800 MB of panel, not the 200 MB
   ! the choice was justified by. Value and reasoning disagree by four times.

   real(dp), parameter, public :: DF_PAIR_SCREEN = 1.0e-12_dp
      !! Below this, a shell pair contributes no three-centre integral.
      !!
      !! Schwarz: `|(mn|P)| <= sqrt((mn|mn)) sqrt((P|P))`, so a pair whose
      !! bound times the largest auxiliary diagonal falls under this cannot
      !! reach it, for any P, and the whole shell triplet is skipped.
      !!
      !! 1e-12 rather than the 1e-10 the literature usually quotes, because the
      !! validation suite compares total energies at 1e-9 and a fitted energy
      !! has already spent its error budget on the fit.

   integer, parameter, public :: DF_AUX_CHUNK = 32
      !! Auxiliary functions per thread chunk in the fitted Coulomb build.
      !!
      !! Both halves of J are BLAS-2 over a column block of B, and this is how
      !! wide a block is: small enough that a few thousand auxiliary functions
      !! still make many more chunks than there are threads, large enough that
      !! the per-call BLAS overhead is not paid n_aux times.

   !! Maximum length for element symbols (e.g., "He", "Uue")
   ! TODO(mqc): redefined privately, and identically, in `mqc_geometry` and
