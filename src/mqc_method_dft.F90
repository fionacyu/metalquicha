!! Density Functional Theory (DFT) method implementation for metalquicha
module mqc_method_dft
   !! Kohn-Sham density functional theory.
   !!
   !! Dispatches to whichever backend `model.backend` names, exactly as
   !! `mqc_method_hf` does; the CPU path is `run_czt_hf`, which takes the
   !! functional as one more setting on the same SCF.
   !!
   !! Density fitting is not optional on cuEST: it has no conventional
   !! four-index ERI path, so J (and K for hybrids) are always fitted and an
   !! auxiliary JKFIT basis is required. `density_fitting` is ignored by that
   !! backend rather than switchable. The amount of exact exchange is queried
   !! from cuEST's XC plan rather than assumed from the functional name, so a
   !! hybrid cannot end up with mismatched Coulomb and XC definitions.
