module mqc_lebedev
   !! Lebedev-Laikov angular quadrature on the unit sphere
   !!
   !! A Lebedev grid is a union of orbits of the octahedral group: pick a seed
   !! point, apply every coordinate permutation and sign flip, and every point
   !! produced carries the same weight. So the whole grid -- 5810 points at the
   !! largest order -- is stored as 1287 (code, a, b, weight) records in
   !! `mqc_lebedev_data`, and expanded here.
   !!
   !! The six orbit types differ only in their seed:
   !!
   !!    code 0   (1, 0, 0)                        6 points
   !!    code 1   (0, s, s)      s = sqrt(1/2)    12 points
   !!    code 2   (t, t, t)      t = sqrt(1/3)     8 points
   !!    code 3   (a, a, b)      b = sqrt(1-2a^2) 24 points
   !!    code 4   (a, b, 0)      b = sqrt(1-a^2)  24 points
   !!    code 5   (a, b, c)      c = sqrt(1-a^2-b^2)  48 points
   !!
   !! `expand_orbit` generates the points from the seed and discards
   !! duplicates, which is where the smaller counts come from: a seed with a
   !! repeated or zero coordinate has a smaller orbit than the 48 of a general
   !! point. The expected size is asserted.
   !!
   !! Weights are normalised to sum to 1: the 4*pi of the sphere's surface is
   !! not included and must be supplied by the caller if it is wanted.

      !! Two generated points closer than this are the same point. Seeds differ
