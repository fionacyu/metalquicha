!! DIIS subspace acceleration for SCF
module mqc_diis
   !! Holds the DIIS history and produces the extrapolated Fock matrix.
   !!
   !! Pure linear algebra over flat vectors, with no integrals backend behind
   !! it. Vectors are stored flat, one column per subspace entry, which serves
   !! the restricted case (one n_ao*n_ao Fock) and the unrestricted case (both
   !! spins stacked into one vector) through the same code.
