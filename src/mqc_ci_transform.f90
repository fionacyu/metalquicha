!! Carrying a CI vector from one orbital basis to another
module mqc_ci_transform
   !! A complete active space is invariant under rotation of its active
   !! orbitals: the same wave function, expanded in a different set of
   !! determinants. This module performs that re-expansion, so that a CI which
   !! has been solved in one basis need not be solved again in the other.
   !!
   !! With orbitals related by an orthogonal `T`,
   !!
   !!     |q> = sum_p |p> T(p,q)
   !!
   !! a string of creation operators factorizes into a sum over strings of the
   !! other basis with a **minor determinant** as its coefficient:
   !!
   !!     M(I,J) = det( T[ occ(I), occ(J) ] )
   !!
   !! -- rows the orbitals occupied in `I`, columns those occupied in `J`, both
   !! in ascending order. Alpha and beta factorize independently, so the whole
   !! transformation of a rectangular CI vector is two matrix products:
   !!
   !!     C' = M_alpha^T C M_beta
   !!
   !! **`M` is exactly the size of the CI vector, and the transformation costs
   !! one dimension more.** For a CAS(14,14) the products are 3432 cubed, which
   !! is dense BLAS.
   !!
   !! **`M` inherits `T`'s orthogonality**, for every electron count at once, so
   !! a violation means the rotation handed in was not what it claimed to be
   !! rather than that this arithmetic is wrong. `rotation_is_orthogonal` is the
   !! check.
