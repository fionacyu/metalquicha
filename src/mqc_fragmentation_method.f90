!! Which fragmentation method a deck asked for
module mqc_fragmentation_method
   !! **`keywords.fragmentation.method` was required, validated for presence,
   !! and then never read.**
   !!
   !! The expansion was chosen by two other keys instead: `expansion`, taking
   !! `mbe`/`ee-mbe`/`fmo`, and the separate boolean
   !! `allow_overlapping_fragments` for GMBE. Neither was checked against a
   !! list of values either, so a misspelled `expansion` fell through to a
   !! plain MBE without a word.
   !!
   !! What that produced is visible in this repository's own decks: all 33
   !! fragmented cases say `method: "MBE"`, including the five that run FMO or
   !! EE-MBE and the four that run GMBE. The file says one thing and the run
   !! does another, and `method: "wibble"` was accepted just as readily --
   !! measured, on `fmo3_water3.json`, which returns the same FMO energy to
   !! twelve figures whatever that key says.
   !!
   !! So the key means something now. It names the method, it is checked
   !! against the list below, and `expansion` and `allow_overlapping_fragments`
   !! are derived from it rather than read independently.
   !!
   !! ### Adding one
   !!
   !! A new expansion needs an integer here, a `case` in each of the three
   !! procedures, and nothing else -- the adapter reads the mapping rather than
   !! branching on a name. `efmo` is listed and refused for exactly that
   !! reason: the name is reserved, and a deck that asks for it gets "not
   !! implemented yet" rather than "unknown method", which are different facts.
