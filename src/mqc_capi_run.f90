!! The C entry point that actually computes something
module mqc_capi_run
   !! Runs a calculation on a system handle, optionally with a supplied term
   !! list, across every rank of the session.
   !!
   !! This is where the three handles meet. A caller builds a system, builds or
   !! screens a term list, says what to compute in a JSON settings document,
   !! and hands all three over; the job's other ranks -- which have seen none
   !! of it -- are brought up to date and take part.
   !!
   !! **The settings travel as JSON text rather than as a struct.** Text has no
   !! field list to keep in step, where a broadcast `method_config_t` that
   !! missed one would leave the workers running a slightly different method
   !! than rank 0 asked for and still report a number. It also puts the workers
   !! through the same validator as any input deck.
   !!
   !! The system does *not* travel that way: it carries conventions -- the
   !! monomer padding, 0-based atoms against 1-based monomers -- that a
   !! document would have to re-derive on arrival.
